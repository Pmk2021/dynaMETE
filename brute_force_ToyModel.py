    This function will iterate DynaMETE t steps. Returns vectors of lambdas, state variables, and time derivatives.
    1. Update state variables using time derivatives
    2. Put new state variables into transition functions
    3. Update time derivatives
    4. Update structure function
    The first step is slightly different. We can either pass in only the state variables and parameters,
    in which case the theory assumes that we start in METE and calculates the corresponding lambdas and derivatives,
    or we can pass in lambdas and derivatives explicitly to iterate from anywhere.
    The former is basically the perturbation way, and the latter is a generic iteration.

    Inputs
    t is the integer number of steps
    l0 are initial lambdas
    s0 are initial state variables, call S, N
    p are parameters, call b0, d0, Nc
        Note that if we want to change this over time we have to put in an array for p, which isn't implemented here.
    ds0 are initial derivatives of state variables, call dS, dN
    dt is how much of one year is a time step. The default is 0.2 to make sure the steps are relatively small.'''
